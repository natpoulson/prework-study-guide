        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML refers to elements that describe the context of their contents. This is useful for assistive technologies such as screen readers, as it helps organise the order in which content is presented or narrated.</li>
          <li>The h1 to h6 tags are used to mark headings for content. As a rule-of-thumb, the h1 tag should only be used once.</li>
          <li>All HTML elements can have attributes, which are included in the opening section of a tag. Examples of attributes include "class", "id", and "href".</li>
          <li>The position of the opening and closing tags (on elements that use them) are used to indicate the hierarchy of elements. Elements placed in the space between another elemement's tags are considered to be children of that element. An example of such a relationship is the "body" tag, which contains the majority of a page's content.</li>
