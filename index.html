        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>head</code> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <code>body</code> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML refers to elements that describe the context of their contents. This is useful for assistive technologies such as screen readers, as it helps organise the order in which content is presented or narrated.</li>
          <li>The <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> tags are used to mark headings for content. As a rule-of-thumb, the <code>h1</code> tag should only be used once.</li>
          <li>All HTML elements can have attributes, which are included in the opening section of a tag. Examples of attributes include "<code>class</code>", "<code>id</code>", and "<code>href</code>".</li>
          <li>The position of the opening and closing tags (on elements that use them) are used to indicate the hierarchy of elements. Elements placed in the space between another element's tags are considered to be children of that element. An example of such a relationship is the "<code>body</code>" tag, which contains the majority of a page's content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A <code>margin</code> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Using the <code>auto</code> value for margin will cause it to automatically take up available space on the side(s) it was specified for, provided a fixed height and width are defined.</li>
          <li><code>padding</code> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The representation of the components within an element is commonly referred to as the "box model".</li>
          <li>From outermost to innermost, the box model comprises of: margins, borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>The <code>box-sizing</code> property dictates how the sizes of elements are calculated in the browser, and they come in two different modes:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>content-box</code> (Default) - Calculates element size based on the content only, both padding and margins are calculated independently meaning the box itself can be much larger than its defined width and height.</li>
            <li><code>border-box</code> - Calculates element size up to the border of the box. The padding shares space with the content with its value representing a fixed or relative ratio of space between the content and the border, and the margin defines the space between the element and others.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The asterisk <code>*</code> is a universal selector and applies to all elements.</li>
          <li>Multiple elements can be selected in one rule by delimiting each one with a comma. This can be used in conjunction with elements that have ID, Class, and other selectors.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Examples of control flows include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Conditionals - Such as <code>if</code> and <code>switch...case</code>.</li>
            <li>Loops - Such as <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do...until</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Variable types:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>var</code> - The original, globally-scoped variable type. This means that any part of the code can access or modify the value contained. Not recommended in most cases for modern JS.</li>
            <li><code>let</code> - Mutable, variable type, which allows for its data to be changed. Used when you need to be able to change the data type or contents of certain types like Strings and Numbers.</li>
            <li><code>const</code> - (Mostly) immutable variable. Once created, the value (excepting in the case of the contents of arrays and objects) cannot be modified.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>As a rule of thumb, you should use <code>const</code> as often as possible, use <code>let</code> for variables that need to be able to change, and <code>var</code> only in situations where neither of the aformentioned are suitable.</li>
          <li>Scope defines the range with which a variable can be accessed. There are three scopes - Global, Function, and Block</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Global - Variable can be accessed from anywhere within the script or file it's declared in. For example:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Any variables declared anywhere outside any function or code block.</li>
              <li>Any variable declared with <code>var</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Function - Variable can be accessed from anywhere within a function, or blocks within the function. For example:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A function called <code>toast()</code> with the variable <code>temperature</code>, can be used by any part of the code inside <code>toast()</code> but not in another function called <code>addBread()</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Block - Variable can only be accessed from within the block of code it's running from, such as an <code>if</code> statement, or <code>for</code> loop. For example:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A variable in a <code>for</code> loop called <code>i</code>, which is used to track the steps, can't be used by the function it's contained in.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Variables in a given scope can be accessed by functions or code blocks nested under them in the hierarchy (Global &gt; Function &gt; Block). These capabilities are referred to as Closures.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The process of accessing a value in Closure is known as Hoisting.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Unlike CSS, which should be declared as early in the document flow as possible (in the <code>head</code>), <code>script</code> tags should be declared in the <code>body</code> at the end. This allows the DOM time to load in so code such as event listeners can be registered successfully.</li>
