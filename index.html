        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>head</code> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <code>body</code> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML refers to elements that describe the context of their contents. This is useful for assistive technologies such as screen readers, as it helps organise the order in which content is presented or narrated.</li>
          <li>The <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> tags are used to mark headings for content. As a rule-of-thumb, the <code>h1</code> tag should only be used once.</li>
          <li>All HTML elements can have attributes, which are included in the opening section of a tag. Examples of attributes include "<code>class</code>", "<code>id</code>", and "<code>href</code>".</li>
          <li>The position of the opening and closing tags (on elements that use them) are used to indicate the hierarchy of elements. Elements placed in the space between another element's tags are considered to be children of that element. An example of such a relationship is the "<code>body</code>" tag, which contains the majority of a page's content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A <code>margin</code> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Using the <code>auto</code> value for margin will cause it to automatically take up available space on the side(s) it was specified for, provided a fixed height and width are defined.</li>
          <li><code>padding</code> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The representation of the components within an element is commonly referred to as the "box model".</li>
          <li>From outermost to innermost, the box model comprises of: margins, borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>The <code>box-sizing</code> property dictates how the sizes of elements are calculated in the browser, and they come in two different modes:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><code>content-box</code> (Default) - Calculates element size based on the content only, both padding and margins are calculated independently meaning the box itself can be much larger than its defined width and height.</li>
            <li><code>border-box</code> - Calculates element size up to the border of the box. The padding shares space with the content with its value representing a fixed or relative ratio of space between the content and the border, and the margin defines the space between the element and others.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The asterisk <code>*</code> is a universal selector and applies to all elements.</li>
          <li>Multiple elements can be selected in one rule by delimiting each one with a comma. This can be used in conjunction with elements that have ID, Class, and other selectors.</li>
